# SBT Docker image

sbt is a build tool for Scala, Java, and more.

For general documentation, see http://www.scala-sbt.org/ and https://github.com/sbt/sbt.

This is my sbt Docker image when I need to build something through Docker multistage feature (https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/).

If you want an example of how to use this image, glance at: https://github.com/giabar/gb-kafkamanager
